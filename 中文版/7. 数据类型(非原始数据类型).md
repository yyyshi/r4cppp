数据类型

在此贴子中我将会讨论Rust的数据类型。大体上等价于c++中类，结构体和枚举。
Rust的一个不同点是数据和行为比在c++(或者Java，或者其他面向对象的语言)分离的更加完全。
In this post I'll discuss Rust's data types. These are roughly equivalent to
classes, structs, and enums in C++. One difference with Rust is that data and
behaviour are much more strictly separated in Rust than C++ (or Java, or other
OO languages). Behaviour is defined by functions and those can be defined in
行为是由函数定义的，这些函数可以被定义在`traits`和`imp`里面，但是`traits`不包含数据，
他们类似于Java中的接口。我将会在后面的帖子中描述`traits`和`imp`，本帖只描述数据。
traits and `impl`s (implementations), but traits cannot contain data, they are
similar to Java's interfaces in that respect. I'll cover traits and impls in a
later post, this one is all about data.

## Structs
结构体

Rust里面的结构体和c/c++中不带方法的结构体类似。只是单纯的字段列表。通过实例可以更好的了解语法。
A rust struct is similar to a C struct or a C++ struct without methods. Simply a
list of named fields. The syntax is best seen with an example:

```rust
struct S {
    field1: i32,
    field2: SomeOtherStruct
}
```
在此我们定义了一个2个字段的结构体`S`。字段由逗号分隔；如果你喜欢的话，最后一个字段后面
也可以加逗号。
Here we define a struct called `S` with two fields. The fields are comma
separated; if you like, you can comma-terminate the last field too.

结构体生成一种类型。在这个例子中，我们可以使用`S`作为一个类型。`SomeOtherStruct`
假设是另外一个结构体(在例子中作为一个类型被使用)，和c++一样，结构体以值的形式被包含，
也就是说，在内存中没有只想另外一个结构体的指针。
Structs introduce a type. In the example, we could use `S` as a type.
`SomeOtherStruct` is assumed to be another struct (used as a type in the
example), and (like C++) it is included by value, that is, there is no pointer
to another struct object in memory.

结构体中的字段通过`.`操作符和字段名字方式被访问，下面是一个使用结构体的例子：
Fields in structs are accessed using the `.` operator and their name. An example
of struct use:

```rust
fn foo(s1: S, s2: &S) {
    let f = s1.field1;
    if f == s2.field1 {
        println!("field1 matches!");
    }
}
```

在此`s1`是一个传值方式的结构体对象，`s2`是一个以引用方式传递的结构体对象。和方法调用一样
我们都使用`.`来访问，不需要`->`。
Here `s1` is struct object passed by value and `s2` is a struct object passed by
reference. As with method call, we use the same `.` to access fields in both, no
need for `->`.

结构体使用结构化的字面量来进行初始化。结构化说的是每个字段的名字和对应的值。比如：
Structs are initialised using struct literals. These are the name of the struct
and values for each field. For example,

```rust
fn foo(sos: SomeOtherStruct) {
    let x = S { field1: 45, field2: sos };  // initialise x with a struct literal
    println!("x.field1 = {}", x.field1);
}
```

结构体不能是递归的；也就是说，你不可以不能有结构名称的循环，包括定义和字段类型。
这是因为结构体的值语义。所以举例来说，`struct R { r: Option<R> }`是非法的会导致
一个编译错误(下面后介绍更多有关Option的内容)。如果你需要这样的结构你应该使用一些指针类型；
指针的循环是允许的。
Structs cannot be recursive; that is, you can't have cycles of struct names
involving definitions and field types. This is because of the value semantics of
structs. So for example, `struct R { r: Option<R> }` is illegal and will cause a
compiler error (see below for more about Option). If you need such a structure
then you should use some kind of pointer; cycles with pointers are allowed:

```rust
struct R {
    r: Option<Box<R>>
}
```

如果我们在以上的结构体中没有`Option`,将没有办法初始化结构体Rust将会报错。
If we didn't have the `Option` in the above struct, there would be no way to
instantiate the struct and Rust would signal an error.

没有字段的结构体无论在定义还是以字面量方式使用时都不需要加大括号。不过，定义确实需要
一个终止符浩，大概只是为了方便解析。
Structs with no fields do not use braces in either their definition or literal
use. Definitions do need a terminating semi-colon though, presumably just to
facilitate parsing.

```rust
struct Empty;

fn foo() {
    let e = Empty;
}
```

## Tuples
元组
元组是匿名的混杂的数据序列。作为一个类型，他们以一系列的类型被声明在圆括号里。
由于没有名字，他们由结构相互区分。比如，类型`(i32,i32)`是一个整数的组合，`i32,f32,S`
是一个三元组。元组值初始化的方法和元组类型被声明是一样的，但是使用值而不是使用类型的部分。
Tuples are anonymous, heterogeneous sequences of data. As a type, they are
declared as a sequence of types in parentheses. Since there is no name, they are
identified by structure. For example, the type `(i32, i32)` is a pair of
integers and `(i32, f32, S)` is a triple. Tuple values are initialised in the
same way as tuple types are declared, but with values instead of types for the
components, e.g., `(4, 5)`. An example:

```rust
// foo takes a struct and returns a tuple
fn foo(x: SomeOtherStruct) -> (i32, f32, S) {
    (23, 45.82, S { field1: 54, field2: x })
}
```

元组可以通过使用`let`解构的方式被使用。
Tuples can be used by destructuring using a `let` expression, e.g.,

```rust
fn bar(x: (i32, i32)) {
    let (a, b) = x;
    println!("x was ({}, {})", a, b);
}
```

我们会在下次帖子中谈论更多关于解构的内容。
We'll talk more about destructuring next time.


## Tuple structs
元组结构体

Tuple structs are named tuples, or alternatively, structs with unnamed fields.
They are declared using the `struct` keyword, a list of types in parentheses,
and a semicolon. Such a declaration introduces their name as a type. Their
fields must be accessed by destructuring (like a tuple), rather than by name.
Tuple structs are not very common.

```rust
struct IntPoint (i32, i32);

fn foo(x: IntPoint) {
    let IntPoint(a, b) = x;  // Note that we need the name of the tuple
                             // struct to destructure.
    println!("x was ({}, {})", a, b);
}
```

## Enums

Enums are types like C++ enums or unions, in that they are types which can take
multiple values. The simplest kind of enum is just like a C++ enum:

```rust
enum E1 {
    Var1,
    Var2,
    Var3
}

fn foo() {
    let x: E1 = Var2;
    match x {
        Var2 => println!("var2"),
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

However, Rust enums are much more powerful than that. Each variant can contain
data. Like tuples, these are defined by a list of types. In this case they are
more like unions than enums in C++. Rust enums are tagged unions rather than untagged unions (as in C++). 
That means you can't mistake one variant of an enum for another at runtime<sup>[1](#1)</sup>. An example:

```rust
enum Expr {
    Add(i32, i32),
    Or(bool, bool),
    Lit(i32)
}

fn foo() {
    let x = Or(true, false);   // x has type Expr
}
```

Many simple cases of object-oriented polymorphism are better handled in Rust
using enums.

To use enums we usually use a match expression. Remember that these are similar
to C++ switch statements. I'll go into more depth on these and other ways to
destructure data next time. Here's an example:

```rust
fn bar(e: Expr) {
    match e {
        Add(x, y) => println!("An `Add` variant: {} + {}", x, y),
        Or(..) => println!("An `Or` variant"),
        _ => println!("Something else (in this case, a `Lit`)"),
    }
}
```

Each arm of the match expression matches a variant of `Expr`. All variants must
be covered. The last case (`_`) covers all remaining variants, although in the
example there is only `Lit`. Any data in a variant can be bound to a variable.
In the `Add` arm we are binding the two i32s in an `Add` to `x` and `y`. If we
don't care about the data, we can use `..` to match any data, as we do for `Or`.


## Option

One particularly common enum in Rust is `Option`. This has two variants - `Some`
and `None`. `None` has no data and `Some` has a single field with type `T`
(`Option` is a generic enum, which we will cover later, but hopefully the
general idea is clear from C++). Options are used to indicate a value might be
there or might not. Any place you use a null pointer in C++<sup>[2](#2)</sup>.
to indicate a value which is in some way undefined, uninitialised, or false,
you should probably use an Option in Rust. Using Option is safer because you
must always check it before use; there is no way to do the equivalent of
dereferencing a null pointer. They are also more general, you can use them with
values as well as pointers. An example:

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

struct Node {
    parent: Option<Rc<Node>>,
    value: i32
}

fn is_root(node: Node) -> bool {
    match node.parent {
        Some(_) => false,
        None => true
    }
}
```

Here, the parent field could be either a `None` or a `Some` containing an
`Rc<Node>`. In the example, we never actually use that payload, but in real life
you usually would.


There are also convenience methods on Option, so you could write the body of
`is_root` as `node.parent.is_none()` or `!node.parent.is_some()`.

## Inherited mutability and Cell/RefCell

Local variables in Rust are immutable by default and can be marked mutable using
`mut`. We don't mark fields in structs or enums as mutable, their mutability is
inherited. This means that a field in a struct object is mutable or immutable
depending on whether the object itself is mutable or immutable. Example:

```rust
struct S1 {
    field1: i32,
    field2: S2
}
struct S2 {
    field: i32
}

fn main() {
    let s = S1 { field1: 45, field2: S2 { field: 23 } };
    // s is deeply immutable, the following mutations are forbidden
    // s.field1 = 46;
    // s.field2.field = 24;

    let mut s = S1 { field1: 45, field2: S2 { field: 23 } };
    // s is mutable, these are OK
    s.field1 = 46;
    s.field2.field = 24;
}
```

Inherited mutability in Rust stops at references. This is similar to C++ where
you can modify a non-const object via a pointer from a const object. If you want
a reference field to be mutable, you have to use `&mut` on the field type:

```rust
struct S1 {
    f: i32
}
struct S2<'a> {
    f: &'a mut S1   // mutable reference field
}
struct S3<'a> {
    f: &'a S1       // immutable reference field
}

fn main() {
    let mut s1 = S1{f:56};
    let s2 = S2 { f: &mut s1};
    s2.f.f = 45;   // legal even though s2 is immutable
    // s2.f = &mut s1; // illegal - s2 is not mutable
    let s1 = S1{f:56};
    let mut s3 = S3 { f: &s1};
    s3.f = &s1;     // legal - s3 is mutable
    // s3.f.f = 45; // illegal - s3.f is immutable
}
```

(The `'a` parameter on `S2` and `S3` is a lifetime parameter, we'll cover those soon).

Sometimes whilst an object is logically immutable, it has parts which need to be
internally mutable. Think of various kinds of caching or a reference count
(which would not give true logical immutability since the effect of changing the
ref count can be observed via destructors). In C++, you would use the `mutable`
keyword to allow such mutation even when the object is const. In Rust we have
the Cell and RefCell structs. These allow parts of immutable objects to be
mutated. Whilst that is useful, it means you need to be aware that when you see
an immutable object in Rust, it is possible that some parts may actually be
mutable.

RefCell and Cell let you get around Rust's strict rules on mutation and
aliasability. They are safe to use because they ensure that Rust's invariants
are respected dynamically, even though the compiler cannot ensure that those
invariants hold statically. Cell and RefCell are both single threaded objects.

Use Cell for types which have copy semantics (pretty much just primitive types).
Cell has `get` and `set` methods for changing the stored value, and a `new`
method to initialise the cell with a value. Cell is a very simple object - it
doesn't need to do anything smart since objects with copy semantics can't keep
references elsewhere (in Rust) and they can't be shared across threads, so there
is not much to go wrong.

Use RefCell for types which have move semantics, that means nearly everything in
Rust, struct objects are a common example. RefCell is also created using `new`
and has a `set` method. To get the value in a RefCell, you must borrow it using
the borrow methods (`borrow`, `borrow_mut`, `try_borrow`, `try_borrow_mut`)
these will give you a borrowed reference to the object in the RefCell. These
methods follow the same rules as static borrowing - you can only have one
mutable borrow, and can't borrow mutably and immutably at the same time.
However, rather than a compile error you get a runtime failure. The `try_`
variants return an Option - you get `Some(val)` if the value can be borrowed and
`None` if it can't. If a value is borrowed, calling `set` will fail too.

Here's an example using a ref-counted pointer to a RefCell (a common use-case):

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

struct S {
    field: i32
}

fn foo(x: Rc<RefCell<S>>) {
    {
        let s = x.borrow();
        println!("the field, twice {} {}", s.field, x.borrow().field);
        // let s = x.borrow_mut(); // Error - we've already borrowed the contents of x
    }

    let mut s = x.borrow_mut(); // OK, the earlier borrows are out of scope
    s.field = 45;
    // println!("The field {}", x.borrow().field); // Error - can't mut and immut borrow
    println!("The field {}", s.field);
}

fn main() {
    let s = S{field:12};
    let x: Rc<RefCell<S>> = Rc::new(RefCell::new(s));
    foo(x.clone());

    println!("The field {}", x.borrow().field);
}
```

If you're using Cell/RefCell, you should try to put them on the smallest object
you can. That is, prefer to put them on a few fields of a struct, rather than
the whole struct. Think of them like single threaded locks, finer grained
locking is better since you are more likely to avoid colliding on a lock.


##### 1

In C++17 there is `std::variant<T>` type that is closer to Rust enums than unions.

##### 2

Since C++17 `std::optional<T>` is the best alternative of Option in Rust.
