# Unique pointers
独占指针

Rust是一门系统编程语言因此必须提供直接访问内存的权限。如c++一样，Rust是通过指针来达到这一目的的

bare-metal performance in return.

我本打算在一个帖子中涵盖所有Rust关于指针的内容，但是我认为指针这个谈论对象内容太多了。
所以在本帖只会谈论一种指针-独占指针，其他的类型将会在后面的帖子中谈及。
I had intended to cover all of Rust's pointers in one post, but I think the
subject is too large. So this post will cover just one kind - unique pointers -
and other kinds will be covered in follow up posts.

首先，举一个不含指针的例子：
First, an example without pointers:

```rust
fn foo() {
    let x = 75;

    // ... do something with `x` ...
}
```

当我们到达`foo`的末尾，`x`出了作用域(这在c++和Rust中都是一样的)。这意味着这个变量不能再被访问
它的内存不能再被使用。
When we reach the end of `foo`, `x` goes out of scope (in Rust as in C++). That
means the variable can no longer be accessed and the memory for the variable can
be reused.

在Rust中，对于任何类型`T`,我们可以用`Box<T>`来表示一个`T`类型的独占指针。
In Rust, for every type `T` we can write `Box<T>` for an owning (aka unique)
pointer to `T`. We use `Box::new(...)` to allocate space on the heap and
我们使用`Box::new(...)`来在堆上分配空间并使用提供的值来初始化这块空间。这类似于C++
中的`new`.
initialise that space with the supplied value. This is similar to `new` in C++.
For example,

```rust
fn foo() {
    let x = Box::new(75);
}
```

`x`是一个在堆上包含一个值为`75`的指针。`x`的类型为`Box<isize>`。
Here `x` is a pointer to a location on the heap which contains the value `75`.
`x` has type `Box<isize>`; we could have written `let x: Box<isize> =
我们也可以这么写`let x: Box<isize> = Box::new(75);`。这和c++中`int* x = new int(75);`
 是类似的。
Box::new(75);`. This is similar to writing `int* x = new int(75);` in C++.
Unlike in C++, Rust will tidy up the memory for us, so there is no need to call
和c++不同的是，Rust将会帮助我们清理内存，所以不需要像c++中一样调用`free`或者`delete`
`free` or `delete`<sup>[1](#1)</sup>. Unique pointers behave similarly to

values - they are deleted when the variable goes out of scope. In our example,
at the end of the function `foo`, `x` can no longer be accessed and the memory
pointed at by `x` can be reused.

独占指针和c++中一样-使用`*`进行解引用操作。
Owning pointers are dereferenced using the `*` as in C++. E.g.,

```rust
fn foo() {
    let x = Box::new(75);
    println!("`x` points to {}", *x);
}
```

As with primitive types in Rust, owning pointers and the data they point to are
immutable by default. Unlike in C++, you can't have a mutable (unique) pointer to
immutable data or vice versa. Mutability of the data follows from the pointer.
E.g.,

```rust
fn foo() {
    let x = Box::new(75);
    let y = Box::new(42);
    // x = y;         // Not allowed, x is immutable.
    // *x = 43;       // Not allowed, *x is immutable.
    let mut x = Box::new(75);
    x = y;            // OK, x is mutable.
    *x = 43;          // OK, *x is mutable.
}
```

Owning pointers can be returned from a function and continue to live on. If they
are returned, then their memory will not be freed, i.e., there are no dangling
pointers in Rust. The memory will not leak. However, it will eventually go out of
scope and then it will be freed. E.g.,

```rust
fn foo() -> Box<i32> {
    let x = Box::new(75);
    x
}

fn bar() {
    let y = foo();
    // ... use y ...
}
```

Here, memory is initialised in `foo`, and returned to `bar`. `x` is returned
from `foo` and stored in `y`, so it is not deleted. At the end of `bar`, `y`
goes out of scope and so the memory is reclaimed.

Owning pointers are unique (also called linear) because there can be only one
(owning) pointer to any piece of memory at any time. This is accomplished by
move semantics. When one pointer points at a value, any previous pointer can no
longer be accessed. E.g.,

```rust
fn foo() {
    let x = Box::new(75);
    let y = x;
    // x can no longer be accessed
    // let z = *x;   // Error.
}
```

Likewise, if an owning pointer is passed to another function or stored in a
field, it can no longer be accessed:

```rust
fn bar(y: Box<isize>) {
}

fn foo() {
    let x = Box::new(75);
    bar(x);
    // x can no longer be accessed
    // let z = *x;   // Error.
}
```

Rust's unique pointers are similar to C++ `std::unique_ptr`s. In Rust, as in
C++, there can be only one unique pointer to a value and that value is deleted
when the pointer goes out of scope. Rust does most of its checking statically
rather than at runtime. So, in C++ accessing a unique pointer whose value has
moved will result in a runtime error (since it will be null). In Rust this
produces a compile time error and you cannot go wrong at runtime.

We'll see later that it is possible to create other pointer types which point at
a unique pointer's value in Rust. This is similar to C++. However, in C++ this
allows you to cause errors at runtime by holding a pointer to freed memory. That
is not possible in Rust (we'll see how when we cover Rust's other pointer
types).

As shown above, owning pointers must be dereferenced to use their values.
However, method calls automatically dereference, so there is no need for a `->`
operator or to use `*` for method calls. In this way, Rust pointers are a bit
similar to both pointers and references in C++. E.g.,

```rust
fn bar(x: Box<Foo>, y: Box<Box<Box<Box<Foo>>>>) {
    x.foo();
    y.foo();
}
```

Assuming that the type `Foo` has a method `foo()`, both these expressions are OK.

Calling `Box::new()` with an existing value does not take a reference to that
value, it copies that value. So,

```rust
fn foo() {
    let x = 3;
    let mut y = Box::new(x);
    *y = 45;
    println!("x is still {}", x);
}
```

In general, Rust has move rather than copy semantics (as seen above with unique
pointers). Primitive types have copy semantics, so in the above example the
value `3` is copied, but for more complex values it would be moved. We'll cover
this in more detail later.

Sometimes when programming, however, we need more than one reference to a value.
For that, Rust has borrowed pointers. I'll cover those in the next post.

The `std::unique_ptr<T>`, introduced in C++11, is similar in some aspects
to Rust's `Box<T>` but there are also significant differences.

Similarities:
* The memory pointed to by a `std::unique_ptr<T>` in C++11 and a `Box<T>` in Rust
is automatically released once the `std::unique_ptr<T>` goes out of the scope.
* Both C++11's `std::unique_ptr<T>` and Rust's `Box<T>` only exhibit move semantics.

Differences:

1. C++11 allows for a `std::unique_ptr<T>` to be constructed from an existing pointer,
   thereby allowing multiple unique pointers to the same memory. 
   This behaviour is not permitted with `Box<T>`.
2. Dereferencing a `std::unique_ptr<T>` that has been moved to another variable or function,
   causes undefined behavior in C++11. This would be caught at compile time in Rust.
3. Mutability or immutability does not go "through" `std::unique_ptr<T>` 
   -- dereferencing a `const std::unique_ptr<T>` still yields a mutable 
   (non-`const`) reference to the underlying data. In Rust, an immutable
   `Box<T>` does not allow mutation of the data it points to.

`let x = Box::new(75)` in Rust may be interpreted as `const auto x =
std::unique_ptr<const int>{new int{75}};` in C++11 and `const auto x =
std::make_unique<const int>(75);` in C++14.
